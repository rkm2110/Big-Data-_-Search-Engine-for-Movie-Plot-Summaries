# Search-Engine-for-Movie-Plot-Summaries
 Built a Search Engine for the dataset of movie plot summaries available from the Carnegie Movie Summary Corpus site. Created a tf-idf for every term and every document using the MapReduce method. The search engine could give the top 10 movies based on the query.
